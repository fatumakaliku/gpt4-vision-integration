## GPT-4 Turbo Vision Integration

### Overview

This project demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI's GPT models, specifically gpt-3.5-turbo and its potential upgrade to GPT-4 Vision (gpt-4-vision-preview), using the OpenAI Python API. The primary goal is to set up a conversational AI system capable of generating text-based responses, with optional enhancements to process images using GPT-4 Vision capabilities.

### Features
#### 1. Text-based Conversational AI:
 Communicate with OpenAI's GPT models to generate helpful responses to user prompts.
#### 2. Image Processing (optional): 
Upgrade to GPT-4 Vision to enable image input processing for advanced use cases like image analysis and visual question answering.

### Requirements
Python 3.7 or higher

OpenAI Python Library

### Installation

Install the OpenAI Python library using pip:


```bash
pip install openai      
```

### Setup
#### 1. API Key:
Obtain an API key from the [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/signup/).

#### 2. Set the API Key in the Script:      
Replace the placeholder API key with your own in the script:

```
python
api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
```

#### 3. Select a Model:
The default model in this project is gpt-3.5-turbo.To use GPT-4 Vision, update the model parameter to:

```
Python

model="gpt-4-vision-preview"
```

### Usage
#### Basic Text Interaction
1. Clone this repository or copy the script into your project directory.
2. Run the Python script to generate text responses:

```
from openai import OpenAI

api_key = "your-openai-api-key"
client = OpenAI(api_key=api_key)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What is GPT-4 Vision?"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

#### (Optional) :Image Processing with GPT-4 Vision

For applications requiring image processing:

1. Update the model to gpt-4-vision-preview.
2. Include image input handling (use OpenAI's documentation for specific API endpoints).

### Example Output
Text-based Query
##### Input:
```
json

[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Explain the difference between GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 Vision."}
]
```
output:

```
text

GPT-3.5 is a powerful text-based conversational model, whereas GPT-4 Vision expands these capabilities to include image processing, enabling tasks such as image recognition and visual question answering.
```

### Image Processing Query (Optional)
#### Input:

 - Upload an image of a chart and ask the model to summarize it.

#### Output:

```
text

This chart shows the sales trends for 2023, with a significant peak in Q3 and a gradual decline in Q4.
```


### Enhancements
 - Support for Image Inputs: Implement image handling to use GPT-4 Vision capabilities effectively.
 - Interactive UI: Create a web or command-line interface for better user interaction.
 - Deployment: Deploy the application as a web app using frameworks like Flask, Django, or Streamlit.
